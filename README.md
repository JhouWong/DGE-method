insect outbreak: raw ring width data and the investigation of the insect outbreaks, year,insect species, and severty.

Raw Tree-Ring Width Data and density figures: The raw ring-width data have been divided into 11 regions by combining proximate sample sites within similar environments. This amplifies the sample size, facilitating the application of the DGEmethod. We chart the density of the ring width index for release, healthy, and depression clusters annually across 11 regions.

DGE method.r is the code for DGE application.

ringwidth_VSLite_qingdao.csv is the vslite model result based on climate data in qingdao climate sataion.
